# Project Title

Project 2 Continuous Control

## Getting Started

This is the implementation of the second project of the Course "Deep Reinforcement Learning" of Udacity. 

### Goal
In this project, I build a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that controls a robotic arm within Unity's Reacher environment. The goal is to get one robotic arm to maintain contact with the green spheres.

A reward of +0.1 is provided for each timestep that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of the agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

In order to solve the environment, our agent must achieve a score of +30 averaged across all 20 agents for 100 consecutive episodes.
#### Prerequisites
    1. To set up your Python environment correctly follow this link.

    2. To download the Unity Environment follow:
        This link for Linux (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux.zip)
        This link for OSX (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher.app.zip)
        This link for Microsoft 32 bits (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
        This link for Microsoft 64 bits (For Windows users) Check out this link if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system. (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)

    3. Then, place the file in the p2_continuous-control/ folder in the DRLND GitHub repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file.

   4.  The training can be run directly in the notebook
